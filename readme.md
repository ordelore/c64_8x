# Dependencies
To run this on a calculator, the user must have a copy of a Commodore 64 Kernal and Basic ROM, which must be converted to AppVars called C64KERN and C64BASIC using `convbin`

# Building
Make sure you have the latest version of the toolchain. There's nothing to see with the default build, unfortunately.
```bash
make
```

If you want to see the traces on CEmu, make sure to build with the debug libraries
```bash
make debug
```
